Ideas are funny things. You never know which ones are going to be useful roads for your mind to wander down and which are //cul-de-sacs//. The only way to find out is to explore the idea but travel lightly enough that it is easy to get back. Sometimes you need to take others on the journey as they may be able to spot things you missed. This site is is the first in a series of ideas that are lightly sketched to provide a path for others to follow.

Part of the motivation for the pieces is to avoid the ``brain crack'' [((bibcite braincrack))] nature of an un-shared idea. I have several sketch books that are filled with partially developed ideas that have never seen the light of day. 

Sometimes I just want to stop thinking about an idea and find that writing about it helps. Otherwise I can spend an inordinate amount of time imagining the implications and consequences of a concept. Best just to ride the wave and see where it takes me. However without a record I could find myself in the same position six months later as the idea strikes me anew. 

This is an attempt to get those ideas out in the wild, out of my head, sooner rather than later.
