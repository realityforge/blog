> The computer programmer is a creator of universes for which he alone is responsible. Universes of virtually unlimited complexity can be created in the form of computer programs. â€” Joseph Weizenbaum

Software is one of the more more interesting materials that can be used to create artifacts; infinitely malleable, yet requiring precise specification, an interaction of many dynamically changing elements. To be a good software developer you need to be part craftsman, part engineer and part artist (and in some scenarios part politician). A good software developer tends to incorporate processes that enhance their work. Unfortunately, many of the prevailing software development methodologies are more aimed at reducing the damage a bad software developer can do to a project rather than enhancing what a good developer can do.

This is the launch page for some ideas on software development that I have developed over the years.
