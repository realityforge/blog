this style look at all familiar? It should! This is, to put it as
impolitely as possible, n00b-style. (Incidentally, if u dont no wat a
n00b iz, u r 1.)<br><br>This is how junior programmers write code.  If you've read Malcom Gladwell's remarkable and eye-opening book <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316346624?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=steveysblogra-20&amp;link_code=wql&amp;camp=212361&amp;creative=380601">The Tipping Point</a>,
you'll notice a striking similarity to the real-life 2-year-old Emily
he describes in Chapter Three, who tells herself stories after her
parents leave her room. Here's a short excerpt from one of her stories:
<blockquote> Tomorrow when we wake up from bed, first me and Daddy and
Mommy, you, eat breakfast eat breakfast like we usually do, and then
we're going to play and then soon as Daddy comes, Carl's going to come
over, and then we're going to play a little while. And then Carl and
Emily are both going down to the car with somebody, and we're going to
ride to nursery school [whispered], and then when we get there, we're
all going to get out of the car... </blockquote> Gladwell's account of
Emily is fascinating, as she's allegedly a completely normal
2-year-old; they all do this when Mommy and Daddy aren't around.<br><br>Gladwell explains: <blockquote>
Sometimes these stories were what linguists call temporal narratives.
She would create a story to try to integrate events, actions, and
feelings into one structure — a process that is a critical part of a
child's mental development.<br></blockquote> If you look back at the
comments in my hypothetical code from 20 years ago, you'll see that I
was doing exactly what Emily does: making up a temporal narrative in an
attempt to carve out a mental picture of the computation for myself.
These stories I told myself were a critical part of my mental
development as a programmer. I was a child trying to make sense of a
big, scary new world.<br><br>Most programmers go through this phase.  It's perfectly normal.<br><br>In contrast, here's what my code tends to look like today: <pre>(<span class="keyword">defun</span> <span class="function-name">js2-parse-variables</span> (in-for decl-type)<br>  <span class="string">"Parse a 'var', 'const' or 'let' statement or for-loop initializer.<br>IN-FOR is true if we are currently in the midst of the init clause of a for.<br>DECL-TYPE is a token value: either VAR, CONST, or LET depending on context.<br>Returns the parsed statement node."</span><br>  (<span class="keyword">let</span> ((result (make-js2-var-decl-node))<br>        destructuring-init<br>        destructuring<br>        s start tt init name node<br>        (continue t))<br>    <span class="comment-delimiter">;; </span><span class="comment">Examples:<br></span>    <span class="comment-delimiter">;; </span><span class="comment">var foo = {a: 1, b: 2}, bar = [3, 4];<br></span>    <span class="comment-delimiter">;; </span><span class="comment">var {b: s2, a: s1} = foo, x = 6, y, [s3, s4] = bar;<br></span>    (<span class="keyword">while</span> continue<br>      (<span class="firebrick">setq</span> destructuring nil<br>            s nil<br>            tt (js2-peek-token)<br>            start js2-token-start<br>            init nil)<br>      (<span class="keyword">if</span> (<span class="keyword">or</span> (= tt js2-LB) (= tt js2-LC))<br>          <span class="comment-delimiter">;; </span><span class="comment">Destructuring assignment, e.g., var [a, b] = ...<br></span>          (<span class="firebrick">setq</span> destructuring (js2-parse-primary-expr))<br>        <span class="comment-delimiter">;; </span><span class="comment">Simple variable name<br></span>        (js2-must-match js2-NAME <span class="string">"msg.bad.var"</span>)<br>        (<span class="firebrick">setq</span> name (make-js2-name-node))<br>        (js2-define-symbol decl-type js2-ts-string))<br>      (<span class="keyword">when</span> (js2-match-token js2-ASSIGN)<br>        (<span class="firebrick">setq</span> init (js2-parse-assign-expr in-for)))<br>      (<span class="keyword">if</span> destructuring<br>          (<span class="keyword">progn</span><br>            (<span class="keyword">if</span> (<span class="peru">null</span> init)<br>                <span class="comment-delimiter">;; </span><span class="comment">for (var [k, v] in foo) is initialized differently<br></span>                (<span class="keyword">unless</span> in-for<br>                  (js2-report-error <span class="string">"msg.destruct.assign.no.init"</span>)))<br>            (<span class="firebrick">setq</span> node (make-js2-destructuring-init-node <span class="builtin">:start</span> start<br>                                                         <span class="builtin">:end</span> js2-ts-cursor<br>                                                         <span class="builtin">:lhs</span> destructuring<br>                                                         <span class="builtin">:initializer</span> init))<br>            (js2-node-add-children node destructuring init))<br>        <span class="comment-delimiter">;; </span><span class="comment">simple variable, possibly with initializer<br></span>        (<span class="firebrick">setq</span> node (make-js2-var-init-node <span class="builtin">:start</span> start<br>                                           <span class="builtin">:end</span> js2-ts-cursor<br>                                           <span class="builtin">:name</span> name<br>                                           <span class="builtin">:initializer</span> init))<br>        (js2-node-add-children node name init))<br>      (js2-block-node-push result node)<br>      (js2-node-add-children result node)<br>      (<span class="keyword">unless</span> (js2-match-token js2-COMMA)<br>        (<span class="firebrick">setq</span> continue nil)))<br>    result))</pre> If I'd seen this code 20 years ago I'd have been appalled.  The lines of code are all crammed together!  Some of them <em>aren't even commented!</em>  If I'd been given the task of maintaining this code, I'd have been screaming "rewrite!"<br><br>I
probably write more Java and JavaScript these days, but I picked an
Emacs-Lisp function I wrote recently to highlight how alien my code
today would have looked to me twenty years ago.<br><br>To be fair, this
function is actually a port of some Java code from Mozilla Rhino's
JavaScript parser, which in turn is a port of some C code from
SpiderMonkey's parser, which in turn was probably borrowed and modified
from some other compiler. Compiler code tends to have some of the
purest lineage around, tracing back to the assembly-language code they
wrote for the first compilers 40 or 50 years ago. Which means it's
going to be a bit on the ugly side compared to "ordinary" code.<br><br>But
when I write code in other languages these days, even in Java, it looks
a lot more like this Emacs Lisp fragment than like the n00b code I was
writing 20 years ago. It's <em>denser</em>: there's less whitespace
and far less commenting. Most of the commenting is in the form of
doc-comments for automated API-doc extraction. On the whole, my code
today is much more compressed.<br><br>In the old days, seeing too much
code at once quite frankly exceeded my complexity threshold, and when I
had to work with it I'd typically try to rewrite it or at least comment
it heavily. Today, however, I just slog through it without complaining
(much). When I have a specific goal in mind and a complicated piece of
code to write, I spend my time making it happen rather than telling
myself stories about it.<br><br><b>A decade of experience makes you a teenager</b><br><br>After
going through their 2-year-old phase, programmers eventually have to go
through a stupid-teenager phase. All this month I've been hearing sad
but unsurprising news stories about teenagers getting stuck on big
rocks, being killed falling off cliffs, or dying of exposure. I'm
actually lucky the same didn't happen to me when I was a teenager. It's
just a bad time for us. Even though teenagers are old enough to
understand the warnings, they have this feeling of invincibility that
gets them into trouble and often mortal peril.<br><br>The programming
equivalent happens around us all the time too. Junior programmers with
five to ten years of experience under their belts (still n00bs in their
own way) attempt to build giant systems and eventually find themselves
stuck on the cliff waiting for a helicopter bailout, telling themselves
"my next system rewrite will be better!" Or they fall off the cliff –
i.e., the project gets canceled, people get laid off, maybe the company
goes under.<br><br>Yes, I've gone through that phase too. And let's
face it: even seasoned programmers need a little optimism and a little
bravery in order tackle real challenges. Even as an experienced
programmer, you should expect to fail at projects occasionally or
you're probably not trying hard enough. Once again, this is all
perfectly normal.<br><br>That being said, as a hiring manager or
company owner you should keep in mind that "5 to 10 years of
experience" on a resume does <em>not</em> translate to "experienced";
it means "crazy invincible-feeling teenager with a 50/50 shot at
writing a pile of crap that he or she and his or her team can't handle,
and they'll eventually, possibly repeatedly, try to rewrite it all."
It's just how things are: programmers can't escape being teenagers at
some point.<br><br><b>Building compression tolerance</b><br><br>Hopefully
the scene I've painted so far helps you understand why sometimes you
look at code and you just hate it immediately. If you're a n00b, you'll
look at experienced code and say it's impenetrable, undisciplined crap
written by someone who never learned the essentials of modern software
engineering. If you're a veteran, you'll look at n00b code and say it's
over-commented, ornamental fluff that an intern could have written in a
single night of heavy drinking.<br><br>The sticking point is
compression-tolerance. As you write code through your career,
especially if it's code spanning very different languages and problem
domains, your tolerance for code compression increases. It's no
different from the progression from reading children's books with giant
text to increasingly complex novels with smaller text and bigger words.
(This progression eventually leads to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0141181265?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=steveysblogra-20&amp;link_code=wql&amp;camp=212361&amp;creative=380601">Finnegan's Wake</a>, if you're curious.)<br><br>The question is, what do you do when the two groups (vets and n00bs) need to share code?<br><br>I've
heard (and even made) the argument that you should write for the lowest
common denominator of programmers. If you write code that newer
programmers can't understand, then you're hurting everyone's
productivity and chances for success, or so the argument goes.<br><br>However,
I can now finally also see things from the veteran point of view. A
programmer with a high tolerance for compression is actually hindered
by a screenful of storytelling. Why? Because in order to understand a
code base you need to be able to pack as much of it as possible into
your head. If it's a complicated algorithm, a veteran programmer wants
to see the whole thing on the screen, which means reducing the number
of blank lines and inline comments – <em>especially</em> comments that
simply reiterate what the code is doing. This is exactly the opposite
of what a n00b programmer wants. n00bs want to focus on one statement
or expression at a time, moving all the code around it out of view so
they can concentrate, fer cryin' out loud.<br><br>So it's a problem.<br><br>Should
a team write for the least common denominator? And if so, exactly how
compressed should they make the code? I think the question may be
unanswerable. It's like asking for a single format for all books, from
children's books to epic novels. Each team is going to have its own
average preference. I suspect it's a good idea to encourage people to
move their stories into design documents and leave them out of the
code, since a junior programmer forced to work in a compressed code
base may well grow up faster.<br><br>As for me, at this point in my
career I would rather puzzle through a small, dense, complex piece of
code than a massive system with thousands of files containing mostly
comments and whitespace. To some people this trait undoubtedly flags me
as a cranky old dinosaur. Since this is likely the majority of
programmers out there, maybe I <em>am</em> a cranky old dinosaur.  Rawr.<br><br><b>Metadata Madness</b><br><br>Everyone knows that comments are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata">metadata</a>:  information <em>about</em> the data (in this case, the data being your source code.)  But people often forget that comments aren't just a <em>kind</em> of metadata.  Comments and metadata are the same thing!<br><br>Metadata
is any kind of description or model of something else. The comments in
your code are just a a natural-language description of the computation.
What makes metadata <em>meta</em>-data is that it's not strictly
necessary. If I have a dog with some pedigree paperwork, and I lose the
paperwork, I still have a perfectly valid dog.<br><br>You already know
the comments you write have no bearing on the runtime operation of your
code. The compiler just throws them away. And we've established that
one hallmark of a n00b programmer is commenting to excess: in a sense,
modeling every single step of the computation in painstaking detail,
just like Emily modeled her ideal Friday by walking through every step
and reassuring her 2-year-old self that she really did understand how
it was going to work.<br><br>Well, we also know that static types are
just metadata. They're a specialized kind of comment targeted at two
kinds of readers: programmers and compilers. Static types tell a story
about the computation, presumably to help both reader groups understand
the intent of the program. But the static types can be thrown away at
runtime, because in the end they're just stylized comments. They're
like pedigree paperwork: it might make a certain insecure personality
type happier about their dog, but the dog certainly doesn't care.<br><br>If static types are comments, then I think we can conclude that people who rely too much on static types, people who really <em>love</em> the static modeling process, are n00bs.<br><br>Hee hee.<br><br>Seriously,
though: I'm not actually bashing on static-typing here; I'm bashing on
the over-application of it. Junior programmers overuse static typing in
the exact same way, and for the same reasons, as they overuse comments.<br><br>I'll
elaborate by first drawing a parallel to data modeling, which is
another kind of "static typing". If you've been working in a field that
uses relational databases heavily, you'll probably have noticed that
there's a certain personality type that's drawn to relational data
modeling as a career unto itself. They're usually the logical modelers,
not the physical modelers. They may have begun their careers as
programmers, but they find they really love data modeling; it's like a
calling for them.<br><br>If you know the kind of person I'm talking
about, you'll doubtless also have noticed they're always getting in
your way. They band together and form Database Cabals and Schema
Councils and other obstructive bureacracies in the name of safety. And
they spend a lot of time fighting with the engineers trying to get
stuff done, especially at the fringes: teams that are <em>not</em>
working directly with the schema associated with the main revenue
stream for the company, but are out trying to solve tangential problems
and just happen, by misfortune, to be homed in the same databases.<br><br>I've
been in surprisingly many situations at different companies where I had
a fringe team that was being held up by data modelers who were
overly-concerned about data integrity when the real business need was <em>flexibility</em>,
which is sort of the opposite of strong data modeling. When you need
flexible storage, name/value pairs can get you a long, long, LONG way.
(I have a whole blog planned on this topic, in fact. It's one of my
favorite vapor-blogs at the moment.)<br><br>It's obviously important to
do some amount of data modeling. What's not so obvious is when to stop.
It's like commenting your code: newer programmers just don't know when
to quit. When you're a little insecure, adding comments and metadata
are a great security-blanket that make you feel busy when you've in
fact stopped making forward progress and are just reiterating (or
perhaps teaching yourself) what's already been accomplished.<br><br>Hardcore logical data modelers often suffer from an affliction called <em>metadata addiction</em>.
Metadata modeling is seductive. It lets you take things at a leisurely
pace. You don't have to be faced with too much complexity at once,
because everything has to go in a new box before you'll look at it. To
be sure, having <em>some</em> metadata (be it a data model, or static
types, or comments) is important for human communication and to some
extent for performance tuning. But a surprising percentage of people in
our industry take it too far, and make <em>describing</em> an activity more important than the activity itself.<br><br>The metadata-addiction phenomenon applies equally to coders.  Code <em>is</em> data, and data <em>is</em>
code. The two are inextricably linked. The data in your genes is code.
The floor plans for your house are code. The two concepts are actually
indistinguishable, linked at a fundamental level by the idea of an
Interpreter, which sits at the very heart of Computer Science.
Metadata, on the other hand, is more like the kidney of Computer
Science. In practice you can lose half of it and hardly notice.<br><br><b>Creeping bureacracy</b><br><br>I
think that by far the biggest reason that C++ and Java are the
predominant industry languages today, as opposed to dynamic languages
like Perl/Python/Ruby or academic languages like Modula-3/SML/Haskell,
is that C++ and Java cater to both secure and insecure programmers. <br><br>You
can write C++ like straight C code if you like, using buffers and
pointers and nary a user-defined type to be found. Or you can spend
weeks agonizing over template metaprogramming with your peers, trying
to force the type system to do something it's just not powerful enough
to express. Guess which group gets more actual work done? My bet would
be the C coders. C++ helps them iron things out in sticky situations
(e.g. data structures) where you need a little more structure around
the public API, but for the most part they're just moving data around
and running algorithms, rather than trying to coerce their
error-handling system to catch programmatic errors. It's fun to try to
make a bulletproof model, but their peers are making them look bad by
actually deploying systems. In practice, trying to make an error-proof
system is way more work than it's worth.<br><br>Similarly, you can
write Java code more or less like straight C, and a lot of seasoned
programmers do. It's a little nicer than C because it has
object-orientation built in, but that's fairly orthogonal to the static
type system. You don't need static types for OOP: in fact OOP was born
and proven in dynamic languages like Smalltalk and Lisp long before it
was picked up by the static-type camps. The important elements of OOP
are <em>syntax</em> (and even that's optional) and an object model implemented in the runtime.<br><br>So
you can write Java code that's object-oriented but C-like using arrays,
vectors, linked lists, hashtables, and a minimal sprinkling of classes.
Or you can spend years creating mountains of class hierarchies and
volumes of UML in a heroic effort to tell people stories about all the
great code you're going to write someday.<br><br>Perl, Python and Ruby
fail to attract many Java and C++ programmers because, well, they force
you to get stuff done. It's not very easy to drag your heels and dicker
with class modeling in dynamic languages, although I suppose some
people still manage. By and large these languages (like C) force you to
face the computation head-on. That makes them really unpopular with
metadata-addicted n00bs. It's funny, but I used to get really pissed
off at Larry Wall for calling Java programmers "babies". It turns out
the situation is a little more complicated than that... but only a
little.<br><br>And Haskell, OCaml and their ilk are part of a
45-year-old static-typing movement within academia to try to force
people to model everything. Programmers hate that. These languages will
never, <em>ever</em> enjoy any substantial commercial success, for the
exact same reason the Semantic Web is a failure. You can't force people
to provide metadata for everything they do. They'll hate you.<br><br>One
very real technical problem with the forced-modeling approaches that
static type systems are often "wrong". It may be hard to imagine,
because by a certain definition they can't be "wrong": the code (or
data) is programmatically checked to conform to whatever constraints
are imposed by the type system. So the code or data always matches the
type model. But the type system is "wrong" whenever it <em>cannot</em>
match the intended computational model. Every time want to use multiple
inheritance or mixins in Java's type system, Java is "wrong", because
it can't do what you want. You have to take the most natural design and
corrupt it to fit Java's view of the world.<br><br>An important
theoretical idea behind type systems is "soundness". Researchers love
to go on about whether a type system is "sound" or not, and "unsound"
type systems are considered bad. C++ and Java have "unsound" type
systems. What researchers fail to realize is that until they can come
up with a type system that is never "wrong" in the sense I described
earlier, they will continue to frustrate their users, and their
languages will be abandoned for more flexible ones. (And, Scala folks,
it can't just be <em>possible</em> to express things like property lists – it has to be <em>trivial</em>.)<br><br>To
date, the more "sound" a type system is, the more often it's wrong when
you try to use it. This is half the reason that C++ and Java are so
successful: they let you stop using the type system whenever it gets in
your way.<br><br>The other half of their success stems from the ability
to create user-defined static types. Not, mind you, because they're
helpful in creating solidly-engineered systems. They are, sure. But the
reason C++ and Java (particularly Java) have been so successful is that
their type systems form a "let's not get any work done" playground for
n00bs to spend time modeling things and telling themselves stories.<br><br>Java has been <em>overrun</em>
by metadata-addicted n00bs. You can't go to a bookstore or visit a
forum or (at some companies) even go to the bathroom without hearing
from them. You can't actually model everything; it's formally
impossible and pragmatically a dead-end. But they try. And they tell
their peers (just like our metadata-addicted logical data modelers)
that you have to model <em>everything</em> or you're a Bad Citizen.<br><br>This
gets them stuck on cliffs again and again, and because they're
teenagers they don't understand what they did wrong. Static type models
have weight and inertia. They take time to create, time to maintain,
time to change, and time to work around when they're wrong. They're <em>just</em>
comments, nothing more. All metadata is equivalent in the sense of
being tangential documentation. And static type models get directly in
the way of flexibility, rapid development, and system-extensibility.<br><br>I've
deleted several thousand words about the evolution of Apache Struts and
WebWork, an example framework I chose to illustrate my point. Rather
than waste a bunch of time with it, I'll just give you a quote from one
of the Struts developers in "The Evolution of Struts 2": <blockquote>...the
Struts 1 code base didn’t lend itself to drastic improvements, and its
feature set was rather limited, particularly lacking in features such
as Ajax, rapid development, and extensibility."</blockquote> Struts 2
was thrown away for WebWork, which was in the process of throwing away
version 1 (for similar reasons) in favor of version 2 (which has all
the same problems).<br><br>Some of those several thousand words were
devoted to JUnit 4, which has comically (almost tragically) locked on,
n00b-style, to the idea that Java 5 annotations, being another form of
metadata, are the answer to mankind's centuries of struggle. They've
moved all their code out of the method bodies and into the annotations
sections. It's truly the most absurd overuse of metadata I've ever
seen. But there isn't space to cover it here; I encourage you to go
goggle at it.<br><br>There are die-hard Java folks out there who are
practically gasping to inject the opinion, right here, that "rapid
development" is a byproduct of static typing, via IDEs that can
traverse the model.<br><br>Why, then, was Struts considered by its own
developers to be a failure of rapid development? The answer, my dear
die-hard Java fans, is that a sufficiently large model can outweigh its
own benefits. Even an IDE can't make things go faster when you have ten
thousand classes in your system. Development slows because you're being
buried in metadata! Sure, the IDE can help you navigate around it, but
once you've created an ocean, even the best boats in the world take a
long time to move around it.<br><br>There are hundreds of open-source
and proprietary Java frameworks out there that were designed by
code-teenagers and are in perpetual trouble. I've often complained that
the problem is Java, and while I think the Java language (which I've
come to realize is disturbingly Pascal-like) is partly to blame, I
think the bigger problem is cultural: it's hard to restrain metadata
addiction once it begins creeping into a project, a team, or an
organization.<br><br>Java programmers, and logical data modelers, and
other metadata-addicted developers, are burying us with their
"comments" in the form of models within their static type system. Just
like I did when I was a n00b. But they're doing it with the best of
intentions, and they're young and eager and energetic, and they stand
on street corners and hand you leaflets about how great it is to model
everything.<br><br>Seasoned programmers ignore them and just get it done.<br><br><b>Solutions and takeaways</b><br><br>Software engineering is hard to get right.  One person's pretty data model looks like metadata-addiction to another person.<br><br>I
think we can learn some lessons from code-commenting: don't try to
model everything! You need to step back and let the code speak for
itself.<br><br>For instance, as just one random illustrative example,
you might need to return 2 values from a function in Java (a language
with no direct support for multiple return values). Should you model it
as a <code>MyFunctionCallResult</code> class with named <code>ValueOne</code> and <code>ValueTwo</code>
fields (presumably with actual names appropriate to the problem at
hand)? Or should you just return a 2-element array (possibly of mixed
types) and have the caller unpack it?<br><br>I think the general answer to this is:  <b>when in doubt, don't model it</b>.  Just get the code written, make forward progress.  Don't let yourself get bogged down with the details of modeling a <em>helper</em> class that you're creating for documentation purposes.<br><br>If it's a public-facing API, take a lesson from doc-comments (which should be present even in seasoned code), and <em>do</em>
model it. Just don't go overboard with it. Your users don't want to see
page after page of diagrams just to make a call to your service.<br><br>Lastly,
if you're revisiting your code down the road and you find a spot that's
always confusing you, or isn't performing well, consider adding some
extra static types to clarify it (for you and for your compiler). Just
keep in mind that it's a trade-off: you're introducing clarifying
metadata at the cost of maintenance, upkeep, flexibility, testability
and extensibility. Don't go too wild with it.<br><br>That way the cliff you build will stay small enough for you to climb down without a helicopter rescue.<br><br><b>Postscript</b><br><br>I'm
leaving comments on, at least until "click-my-link" spam starts to
surface. I'm curious to know how this entry goes over. This was an
especially difficult entry to write. I did a lot of editing on it, and
left out a lot as a result. I feel like I may not have made my points
as clearly as I'd like. And I'm sure I haven't convinced the
metadata-addicted that they have a problem, although at least now they
know someone out there thinks they have a problem, which is a start.<br><br>Let me know what you think!
