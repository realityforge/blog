title: About Me
---
You have reached the home page of me - Peter Donald.
On this site you will find a collection of information
about me and my interests. I am currently enrolled as a
research student at "La Trobe University":http://www.latrobe.edu.au in Melbourne, 
Australia. I returned to studies after a brief, three-year 
stint in the real world.

Music is my passion and I am always on the lookout for
new and interesting styles to sample. Aside from music
I am also interested in the enabling technology for
virtual environments (such as 3D games or simulations).
My research focuses on network infrastructure for
virtual environments.

At one stage I was involved in a number of opensource
organizations and was active in technology standardization
organizations such as the Java Community Process. Over
time my involvement in technology-oriented pursuits has
decreased as my interests have changed.

Feel free to browse the site and if you need to contact
me, my email address is below, encoded as an image to decrease the chance it will be harvested by a spam bot.
