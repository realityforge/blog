title: Names
---
I seem to have trouble starting projects without a name that I can use. Crazy as it seems I have waited around on starting on various software projects until a name came along that I liked. So this page is just a list of various names that are "coolish" sounding. It is unlikely that I will use any of them but hopefully they will inspire me enough to pick another name and just get started.

h3. General Names

* Bigimize: My housemate used this term to describe the maximize button.
* Codeworm: Comes from Ear-Worm which is apparently a direct translation from german for a song that gets stuck in your head. A code-worm is a bit of code that you just can get rid of.

h3. Babble Names

Babble was the name of the programming language I started to develop as an experiment. 

* Pod
* Beam
* Jam
* Snuggle
* Gabba
* Snort

h4. Dark Themed Names

Was thinking about using it for the issue tracker that shone light on darkness of software ;)

* Shade
* Dusk
* Spook
* Spark

h4. Space Themed Names

* Space

h3. Character Names

It is always good to have interesting character names when writing a short story and heres my list;

* Deegan
* Drake
* Spark/Sparqs

h4. Role names

* Seekers
* Marines
* Dezign
