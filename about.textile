Ideas are funny things. You never know which ones are going to be useful roads for your mind to wander down and which are _cul-de-sacs_. The only way to find out is to explore the idea but travel lightly enough that it is easy to get back. Sometimes you need to take others on the journey as they may be able to spot things you missed. This site catalogs a series of ideas that are lightly sketched to provide a path for others to follow.

Part of the motivation for the pieces is to avoid the "brain crack":#BrainCrack nature of an un-shared idea. I have several sketch books that are filled with partially developed ideas that have never seen the light of day. 

Sometimes I just want to stop thinking about an idea and find that writing about it helps. Otherwise I can spend an inordinate amount of time imagining the implications and consequences of a concept. Best just to ride the wave and see where it takes me. However without a record I could find myself in the same position six months later as the idea strikes me anew. 

This is an attempt to get those ideas out in the wild, out of my head, sooner rather than later.

So who am I? I am that guy who likes rock climbing, caving and hiking. Oh wait - no I am that guy who loves the music but despite owning a plethora of instruments can not play a single one of them. Or I could be that guy you have seen playing with poi, juggling knives or a unicycle down the park. Or did we meet on some adventure in some far off land? Most likely if you reached this site you know me as that guy who hates computers but loves programming stuff. Then there was all that other stuff I liked such as psychology, philosophy, linguistics, mythology and history but that is a whole other kettle of fish.

Once upon a time I was enrolled in a PhD student at "La Trobe University":http://www.latrobe.edu.au in Melbourne but thankfully I have now submitted. I realized that the PhD is no escape and I much prefer the real world where I work at the _Department of Sustainability and Environment_.

h4. Brain Crack

<a name="BrainCrack"></a> Internet personality Ze Frank coined the term "brain crack" to describe the addictive nature of holding tightly onto ideas instead of sharing them. See "washington, ideas, brain crack":http://www.zefrank.com/theshow/archives/2006/07/071106.html for further details.
