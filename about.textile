This is my home page. I am that guy who likes rock climbing, caving and hiking. Oh wait - no I am that guy who loves the music but despite owning a plethora of instruments can not play a single one of them. Or I could be that guy you have seen playing with poi, juggling knives or a unicycle down the park. Or did we meet on some adventure in some far off land? Most likely if you reached this site you know me as that guy who hates computers but loves programming stuff. 

Once upon a time I was enrolled in a PhD student at "La Trobe University":http://www.latrobe.edu.au in Melbourne but thankfully I have now submitted. I realized that the PhD is no escape and I much prefer the real world where I work at the _Department of Sustainability and Environment_.    

Feel free to browse the site and if you need to contact me, here is my email address:
