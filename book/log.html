title: My Book Log

<p>
  Even before my PhD I tended to consume books about one thing or another. This
  page aims to keep a log of the books that I have read in the recent past.

              The only GWT book that covers recent versions of GWT. It is comprehensive and informative and it does a
              good job of summarising, condensing and simplifying the information available on the web. As GWT moves at
              a rapid pace, the book is littered with factoids and trivia applicable to earlier versions of the GWT 2.x
              line but no longer relevant. Useful if you need to quickly pick up a technique but not as useful for
              telling you when you should use a particular technique. It should be noted that the edition that I read
              was an early access addition (MEAP 6) so many of these complaints may be addressed in later revisions of
              the book.

              A classic data modelling book that every data modeller should read at one stage or another. The book
              a generic set of conventions for data modellers working in typical enterprises. The book then goes
              through several domain or industry specific data models. This book is very useful if you happen to be
              modelling one of the specific domains described in the book but otherwise can be a little dry. Even so
              there is a reason why it is a classic.

              option. Highly recommended if you need to lear Jax-RS.

              A book that goes through a series of patterns that historically were recommended for J2EE platform and
              re-evaluates them in the context of a modern EE technology stack. Many of the points rang true and mostly
              come down to common sense. However several of the recommendations seem ill founded and to be trend
              following rather than based in solid engineering practices. The book was read based on the strength of
              "Real World Java EE Night Hacks" but unfortunately feels like a string of poorly edited blog posts.

              An interesting book that got me interested in JEE again. It is written by a highly informed and obviously
              experienced professional. The prose was weak and rambling at points and the opinions ot always well
              supported but overall a enjoyable book recommended for anyone working in this space. It walked through
              the development of a JEE application touching on many technologies from JMX, JAX-RS, EJB etc. It also
              refreshingly introduced practical steps on how to deploy and test within a container with relative ease.

              Interesting book that describes craft production, mass production and lean production in the context 
              of the auto industry. The text has a strong favouring of lean production over other forms of production 
              and attempts to support these claims with evidence. It is a bit dry at times but I suspect a seminal 
              work and thus it is worth reading.

              A great book to get started using Chef the configuration management tool. It introduces you to a whole
              new way of automating the infrastructure components of your application. It does this in a test-driven
              manner. In places it feels a bit like a white paper or an advertisement from Chefs owners Opscode but
              overall I would highly recommend it.

              This is the second book I have read that goes into depth about time-oriented databases. In particular it
              gives enough detail for someone to create and maintain both transaction time and valid time tables. One
              thing it has above other literature is that it also describes a development methodology for deriving
              temporal databases in a domain that would greatly aid the beginning practitioners.

              A practical book focused on testing Java applications. Surprisingly this book presents a balanced and
              reasoned description of several techniques, vary rarely making unsupported emotive arguments or seeing
              every problem as a nail to be hammered using the one true hammer (This is not usually found in books
              about testing). While this book is principally about TestNG, may of the same ideas could be applied to
              JUnit 4 with a small amount of work. However after reading this I am hopping to move some of our larger
              projects across to TestNG in short order.

              The premise of this book is that successful teams are not necessarily characterized by the skills of the
              participants but by the "positive relationships" - among team members, between individual members and the
              team, and between the team and external groups. The book suggests that teams may be able to improve by
              adopting practices or habits that reinforce positive relationships and strengthen the team. While most of
              the organizational psychology of this book is hidden away behind the practical tips, the authors academic
              bent pokes through in a few places. The book also seems to focus on non-technical teams but most of the
              advice is still relevant.

              An amazing book that I have been reading on and off since it was released. It is packed with information
              about the practice of continuous delivery and how to introduce it into your organisation. While most of
              the information could be found in other locations, this book brings it together and more importantly it
              integrates it and backs it with both anecdotal stories, statistics and relates it to practices in other
              industries. It is perfectly designed to arm you to describe the benefits to higher ups in the food chain.
              The chapter regarding the automated provisioning of environment was new to me and it may become dated
              over time but hopefully the book will be revised in the future. The only negative in the book is the push
              towards using strategies such as mocking/test-doubles that seem to be based on the authors backgrounds
              rather than an actual need to implement continuous delivery. Other than that - pure excellence.

              The book explains basic economic theory using everyday examples. For someone who has never been
              interested in economics, the book makes it easy and even fun to read about. The book while written to
              be read by a amateur, goes into enough depth that it offers something to those already versed in the
              theory.

              David Hay is a big name in the data modelling industry. This book is interesting in that it seems to
              aimed at Enterprise Architects who want to do high level meta-data modelling. It describes a meta-model
              broken down according to the Zachman's "Framework for Enterprise Architecture". The meta-model is just
              one particular implementation of his concepts and may need to be modified for your particular context if
              his assumptions prove to be inaccurate. However, as he expounds on his reasoning it should be possible
              to adapt his work to your own context.

              A spectacular fiction that educates the reader on what the author believes Enterprise Architecture should
              be rather than what it tends to be. The book makes the argument that the EA practitioner should be
              supporting the CEO rather than a part of an IT group.

              In university I spent two semesters studying myth and it's connection to history; where myths came from,
              how they evolved and the historical evidence to support events in various myths. This book is the
              transcription of a series of interviews with Joseph Campbell that that takes a very different bent.
              This compares and contrasts the mythological beliefs of ancient and modern religions and highlights
              similar themes that appear throughout each tradition. In some cases it traces the development of a theme
              through a tradition such as how elements change in each successive evolution of the Abrahamic religions.

              A book describing how successful companies can lose the leadership position when "disruptive technology"
              emerges. For someone who doesn't read many business oriented books this was simple to understand and
              surprisingly interesting. It may not have been as revolutionary to me as to everyone else and seemed like
              it was mostly common sense. However, this may be because I was never taught anything contrary to the
              central tenant of this book.

              Once upon a time I was a Neuroscience / Psychobiology student and read this book back then. Re-reading
              the book just reminds me how wonderful the human brain is and how good it is at repairing itself and
              how sometimes it gets it wrong with some surprising consequences.
