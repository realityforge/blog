title: My Book Log

<p>
  Even before my PhD I tended to consume books about one thing or another. This
  page aims to keep a log of the books that I have read in the recent past.

              An amazing book that I have been reading on and off since it was released. It is packed with information
              about the practice of continuous delivery and how to introduce it into your organisation. While most of
              the information could be found in other locations, this book brings it together and more importantly it
              integrates it and backs it with both anecdotal stories, statistics and relates it to practices in other
              industries. It is perfectly designed to arm you to describe the benefits to higher ups in the food chain.
              The chapter regarding the automated provisioning of environment was new to me and it may become dated
              over time but hopefully the book will be revised in the future. The only negative in the book is the push
              towards using strategies such as mocking/test-doubles that seem to be based on the authors backgrounds
              rather tha an actual need to implement continuous delivery. Other than that - pure excellence.

              The book explains basic economic theory using everyday examples. For someone who has never been
              interested in economics, the book makes it easy and even fun to read about. The book while written to
              be read by a amateur, goes into enough depth that it offers something to those already versed in the
              theory.

              David Hay is a big name in the data modelling industry. This book is interesting in that it seems to
              aimed at Enterprise Architects who want to do high level meta-data modelling. It describes a meta-model
              broken down according to the Zachman's "Framework for Enterprise Architecture". The meta-model is just
              one particular implementation of his concepts and may need to be modified for your particular context if
              his assumptions prove to be inaccurate. However, as he expounds on his reasoning it should be possible
              to adapt his work to your own context.

              A spectacular fiction that educates the reader on what the author believes Enterprise Architecture should
              be rather than what it tends to be. The book makes the argument that the EA practitioner should be
              supporting the CEO rather than a part of an IT group.

              In university I spent two semesters studying myth and it's connection to history; where myths came from,
              how they evolved and the historical evidence to support events in various myths. This book is the
              transcription of a series of interviews with Joseph Campbell that that takes a very different bent.
              This compares and contrasts the mythological beliefs of ancient and modern religions and highlights
              similar themes that appear throughout each tradition. In some cases it traces the development of a theme
              through a tradition such as how elements change in each successive evolution of the Abrahamic religions.

              A book describing how successful companies can lose the leadership position when "disruptive technology"
              emerges. For someone who doesn't read many business oriented books this was simple to understand and
              surprisingly interesting. It may not have been as revolutionary to me as to everyone else and seemed like
              it was mostly common sense. However, this may be because I was never taught anything contrary to the
              central tenant of this book.

              Once upon a time I was a Neuroscience / Psychobiology student and read this book back then. Re-reading
              the book just reminds me how wonderful the human brain is and how good it is at repairing itself and
              how sometimes it gets it wrong with some surprising consequences.
