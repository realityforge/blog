title: GWT and EJB 3.1
---

<p>
	Recently we have been tasked with building a rich, complex web application for resource planning. 
	Historically most of our applications have been successfully delivered using Rails. However the 
	cost of developing rich applications has been significant and only a few developers are comfortable 
	working with low-level javascript frameworks.
</p>

<p>
	We prototyped the front-end using <a href="http://docs.sencha.com/ext-js/4-0/">ExtJS</a> and
  were looking at implementing the backend technology using EJB 3.1 beans (See
  <a href="#WhyEJB">Why EJB?</a> for our reasoning). We investigated using JSF and GWT as the
  front end technology but eventually settled on GWT, took a <a href="#GWTCourse">course</a>
  and went through a number of <a href="https://github.com/realityforge/gwttle">labs</a> to
  develop a simple GWT application.
</p>

<p>
	The course only gave us a <em>taste</em> of GWT and we still needed to do a bunch of investigation 
	to get a GWT application from "toy" stage to production ready. We took the best practices 
	<a href="http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/articles/mvp-architecture.html">MVP</a> example and 
	started to evolve it towards an archetypal example in our world. This involved adding an automated 
	build system that we could run from our CI box, moving to EJBs for the service layer, JPA for the 
	persistence layer, moving to Intellij IDEA for the IDE and splitting the project out into multiple 
	components that could be worked on independently.
</p>	

<p>
	The code for converting the service layer to EJBs was actually quite simple as is evidenced by the 
	<a href="https://github.com/realityforge/gwt-contacts/commit/32cccacfb1acc7bd67b6859169d85e332dc73dc0">commit</a>.
	However this code does not work in the built-in Jetty container used as part of development mode. 
	The documentation on how to actually use EJBs is rather 
	<a href="http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/doc/latest/DevGuideCompilingAndDebugging.html#How_do_I_use_EJBs_in_development_mode?">thin</a>. 
	In Intellij IDEA, this entailed setting up the IDE to build an exploded war, configuring GlassFish 
	support and passing <code>-noserver</code> to the GWT plugin.
</p>

<p>
	For the build system we initially trialled using <a href="http://maven.apache.org/">Maven 3.0.3</a> 
	but went back to using <a href="http://buildr.apache.org/">Apache Buildr</a>. Maven is a project I 
	want to like and has great ideas but even years after it was developed I keep running into stability 
	issues; plugins don't work, dependencies are not locked by default etc. Buildr is a little rough 
	around the edges but does not get in your way when you want to do something custom. The <a href="https://github.com/realityforge/gwt-contacts/commit/adf66f26c0f7512d7d397b44628badf489cacc55">commit</a> 
	that converted the project to buildr is a perfect example. There is very little code involved in 
	the Buildr files <a href="https://github.com/realityforge/gwt-contacts/blob/adf66f26c0f7512d7d397b44628badf489cacc55/buildfile">buildfile</a>
	and <a href="https://github.com/realityforge/gwt-contacts/blob/adf66f26c0f7512d7d397b44628badf489cacc55/build.yaml">build.yaml</a>
	but there is a fair amount of custom code involved in modifying the Intellij IDEA buildr extension 
	so that it generates custom metadata for the build. Admittedly these customizations will be rolled 
	back into Buildr over time but it was simple to extend core Buildr classes to achieve our immediate 
	needs.
</p>

<p>
  Separating the different elements of the application out into separate components proved to be a
  minor annoyance. The code remained unchanged but the build system had to be refactored significantly
  as did the Buildr customizations to generate the IDEA project files. However, you can see a snapshot of the current work in progress on github project at the tag <a href="https://github.com/realityforge/gwt-contacts/tree/BLOG_POST">BLOG_POST</a>.

<h3>Footnotes</h3>

<h4>Why EJB?</h4>

<p>
	We need to integrate with a thick Swing client over a custom network protocol and a web
  portal &amp; BPMS using SOAP web services as well as the front-end for our new application.
  Candidate service layers included OSGi, Spring and EJB 3.1. Bizarrely enough we chose EJBs
  because it was simpler (!!!) to provide these interfaces in the straight JEE stack. (And yes
  we were very surprised to come to that conclusion too!).

<h4>GWT Course</h4>

<p>
	The <a href="http://www.objecttraining.com.au/Application-Development-using-Google-Web-Toolkit/default.aspx">course</a>
	was delivered by Adam Jenkins at Object Training and it was quite good. About the only complaint
  I have was that some of the architectural labs and talks were too focused on mechanical aspects
  and did not make the reasons for selecting a particular architecture clear. I came away
  thinking that the
	<a href="http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/articles/mvp-architecture.html">GWT MVP</a>
  design pattern was developed by architecture astronauts but after reading more and watching
  a few YouTube <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDuhR18-EdM">clips</a> I am sold on
  the approach.
