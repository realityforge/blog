title: Rails Plugin to Help Debug Views
---
The debug_view_helper plugin was developed to make it easy to add debug information into your views. It was derived from techniques described in "HowtoDebugViews":http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/pages/HowtoDebugViews  and it makes it possible to expose the followng following debug data;

* Request Parameters
* Session Variables
* Flash Variables
* Assigned Template Variables

Typically you add code such as the following to the bottom of your layout that exposes the debug button in development mode.

{% highlight ruby %}
<% if RAILS_ENV == 'development' %>
<center>
  <button onclick="show_debug_popup(); return false;">
    Show debug popup
  </button>
</center>
<%= debug_popup %>
<% end %>
{% endhighlight %}

You can grab the plugin from subversion at;

"http://realityforge.org/svn/code/debug-view-helper/trunk/":http://realityforge.org/svn/code/debug-view-helper/trunk/

**Update:** Added the ability to add inline debug information via the following. Suggestion by  John Dell.

{% highlight ruby %}
<% if RAILS_ENV == 'development' %>
<%= debug_inline %>
<% end %>
{% endhighlight %}
