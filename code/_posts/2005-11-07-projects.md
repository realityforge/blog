Heres a list of projects that I will eventually get around to implementing. They are intended to be relatively small software projects that I can use to lear a new programming language or technique.

-   **iBrag**: A resume generator that will generate a resume for a particular recruiter that includes information they want + standard info. So they select the jobs, experiences, level of detail etc, hit generate and out comes a nicely formatted resume.
-   **iBuild**: A web interface to a continuous integration build system. A cross between [CIA](http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/pages/How+To+Use+CIA+For+Continuous+Integration) and [Luntbuild](http://www.pmease.com/luntbuild/)
-   **iPay**: A simple time tracker that allows me to generate pay slips or charge bills as appropriate. Maybe even generate the appropriate forms ala Blue-Sheets.
-   **iThink**: Combination wiki and mind map that attempts to generate /mental/ distances between concepts/pages.
-   **iKnow**: FAQ Engine
-   **Craggle**: Web 2.0 style climbing routes database
