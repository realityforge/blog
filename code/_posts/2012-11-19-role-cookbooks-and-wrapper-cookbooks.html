title: Role Cookbooks and Wrapper Cookbooks
---

<p>
  Roles in chef are un-versioned. Early in our adoption of chef we defined our roles as a run list and a collection of
  attributes. Our infrastructure is set up such that almost all of our environments share a single chef server and each
  node periodically checks in with the chef server and updates itself as appropriate. We wanted a way for roles to
  propagate between our environments step by step, validating the role met our requirements at each step before being
  promoted to the next step. i.e. A role should be deployed to the 'development' environment and then 'integration',
  'uat', 'staging' and finally 'production'.
</p>
<p>
  Initially we broke our environments a few times when we updated our role definitions. Then we attempted to use an
  ugly naming schema to upgrade roles so we ended up with a scenario where we had the 'myrole_v4' role in 'development',
  the 'myrole_v3' role in the 'uat' environment and the 'myrole_v1' role in the 'production' environment. Finally we
  realized that Chef already has a mechanism for versioning artifacts - namely cookbooks.
</p>

<h3>Role Cookbooks</h3>

<p>
  Today our roles simply include a single recipe, the role recipe. The role recipe then uses "include_recipe" to include
  other recipes in the required order. This allows us to rely on chefs builtin version resolution mechanisms to version
  our roles. Our role and associated 'role cookbook' looks something not unlike the following;
</p>

<h5>roles/foo.rb</h5>
{% highlight ruby %}
name "foo"
description "Foo Server"
run_list("recipe[mybiz-foo]")
{% endhighlight %}

<h5>cookbooks/mybiz-foo/metadata.rb</h5>
{% highlight ruby %}
name "mybiz-foo"
description "Sets up the Foo Server"
version "0.4.2"
...
depends "ntp"
depends "git"
depends "foo"
{% endhighlight %}

<h5>cookbooks/mybiz-foo/recipes/default.rb</h5>
{% highlight ruby %}
include_recipe "ntp"
include_recipe "git"
include_recipe "foo"
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
  Using this approach allowed us to have a single role "foo". However the associated cookbook/recipe may have a
  different version in different environments. This allowed us to easily control the evolution of the role and the
  promotion of the role between different environments.
</p>

<h3>Wrapper Cookbooks</h3>

<p>
  Role cookbooks were great at being able to version the run list of our roles but it did not solve the problem of
  attributes in our roles. The attribute data was what we used to customize the cookbooks for our particular business.
  We had struggled with the interaction between the place the attributes are specified (i.e. node, environment, role,
  cookbook) and the precedence levels (i.e.  default, normal, override and automatic). So we decided to simplify.
</p>
<p>
  For every cookbook and/or recipe we wanted to customize we created a separate 'wrapper' recipe that set the required
  attributes and included the recipe from the original cookbook. This resulted in a layout that looked like the
  following;
</p>

<h5>cookbooks/mybiz-bar/metadata.rb</h5>
{% highlight ruby %}
name "mybiz-bar"
description "Sets up the Bar Server"
version "0.1.3"
...
depends "bar"
{% endhighlight %}

<h5>cookbooks/mybiz-bar/recipes/default.rb</h5>
{% highlight ruby %}

node.override['bar']['port'] = 80
node.override['bar']['interface'] = '0.0.0.0'
node.override['bar']['host'] = 'bar.mybiz.example.com'
node.override['bar']['max_threads'] = 250

include_recipe "bar"
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
  We also decided that wrapper cookbooks would only ever set attributes using the 'override' precedence. Cookbooks set
  attributes using the 'default' precedence if a wrapper cookbook is allowed to override the attribute. Cookbooks can
  also set attributes using the 'override' precedence if they are publishing attribute data for other cookbooks to use
  but do not expect other cookbooks to override the attribute data.
</p>
<p>
  Using this technique, there was effectively only one place to look for customisations and you did not have to think
  about the precedence rules.
</p>

<h3>Role or Wrapper Cookbook?</h3>

<p>
  While I presented role and wrapper cookbooks as separate concepts and separate cookbooks, this need not be the case.
  If the recipe in a wrapper cookbook is only used within a single role cookbook and it is relatively simple then we
  tend to move the wrapper recipe into the role cookbook. Only when there is complex logic required or a cookbook is
  used by multiple roles do we bother creating a separate wrapper cookbook.
</p>

<h3>Environments</h3>

<p>
  Our environments do still have some attribute data within them but the data tends to be used to drive a rules layer.
  For example, our environment attributes specify a data center key. Later, in a wrapper cookbooks we examine the data
  center key and set the appropriate name servers and ntp servers (neither of which are managed by chef).
</p>

<h3>Closing thoughts</h3>

<p>
  These cookbook patterns are not unique to our infrastructure. The wrapper cookbook is in some ways a limited form of
  the "application" cookbook pattern described in the latest Food Fight show
  <a href="http://foodfightshow.org/2012/11/google-plus-hangouts.html">hangout</a>.
  <a href="https://twitter.com/resetexistence">Jamie Winsor</a> from Riot Games has also mentioned role cookbooks as
  did Joseph Holsten on the mailing list.
</p>

<p>
  One thing we have yet to try but I am really excited about is using monkey patching in the wrapper cookbook to modify
  resources defined in the original cookbook after it has been included. Bryan Berry put together the
  <a href="https://github.com/bryanwb/chef-rewind">chef-rewind</a> gem that makes it simple to patch the resources
  already defined. Joshua Timberman also <a href="http://jtimberman.housepub.org/blog/2012/11/19/chef-repository-berkshelf-conversion/">demonstrated</a> a slightly more raw way of modifying
  already defined resources.
